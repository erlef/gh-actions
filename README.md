# gh-actions

Hosts GitHub Actions for the BEAM Community.

Provides pre-built workflows and templates that can be easily
used to automate common tasks such as testing, building, and maintaining
libraries.

> **Note:** This repository is a work in progress. We would like to focus on
> providing actions that are useful across the BEAM ecosystem. But we will be
> starting with actions that are useful for the Elixir since that is the
> community we are most familiar with.
> Regardless, we welcome contributions from all BEAM communities.
